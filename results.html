				<p>Currently, we are able to work with just about 30 atoms before issues
				with the nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm implementation prevent
				our atoms from settling into a local minimum energy configuration. Due
				to this bug, we sometimes allowed the first layer of substrate to
				diffuse so we had more atoms to observe.</p>
				
				<p>Nevertheless, we were able to learn a lot from just a few rough layers.
				Figure 1 shows the progression of homoepitaxial
				film growth over 14 steps, beginning with 18 diffusion-enabled substrate
				atoms. We first set the lattice parameters and bond energies equal to
				prove the concept of off-lattice KMC. It was observed that atoms were
				preferentially deposited over the first five steps, and hopping was
				finally chosen at step 6. After that, hopping began to dominate over
				deposition. This demonstrates the desired effect of the rate-equation
				KMC model; surface diffusion occurs on the order of <span class="math">\(10^{12} s^{-1}\)</span>
				while deposition in a region as small as this might only occur at
				<span class="math">\(10 s^{-1}\)</span>. A surface atom in a monolayer has four nearest neighbor
				bonds, therefore there is a large activation energy barrier to move to a
				site with only one or two bonds. By equation [eq:1], the calculated
				hopping rate would be very small, and therefore the n-fold method is
				very likely to choose deposition. But once there are more surface atoms
				hanging around – some with few bonds and very low activation energies –
				the hopping probability increases significantly. The more surface atoms,
				the more hopping dominates until they all form bonds with each other and
				deposition is favored once again.</p>

				becomes coordinated by 5+ other adatoms, it is colored green. a) Step 4:
				Only deposition has been chosen. b) Step 9: Some atoms have begun to

				<p>In one run with the homoepitaxial parameters, we observed the process of
				vacancy formation. The vacancy in Figure 2 is circled
				in orange. This was the result of random deposition events. Because of
				the process described in 4.2.5, atoms are rarely deposited directly onto
				the surface. Instead, they are gradually shifted down from above until
				they are close enough to be acted upon by the nonlinear conjugate
				gradient. They settle in the first configuration that is energetically
				favorable, which is not necessarily the close-packed configuration. It
				is probable that this vacancy would diffuse and/or disappear over time.</p>

				<p>When attempting to simulate heteroepitaxy, we were obliged to induce
				very large lattice misfit. Otherwise, due to bugs, we would not create
				enough layers to observe dislocation formation. The silver-on-copper
				system has an 18.5% misfit, which was theorized to form dislocations at
				the very first layer (the VM growth mode). Results are shown in Figure
				3. In this case, we did not allow the substrate
				atoms to diffuse. It was observed that adatoms deposited far from other
				adatoms were nicely centered between the substrate atoms below, but the
				introduction of a nearby adatom forced both of them off-center of the
				lattice site. In [fig:Copper-and-Silver,], an attempt to deposit an
				adatom between two existing adatoms resulted in the beginnings of a
				dislocation. It found a lower energy position just above the first layer
				plane. As more adatoms were deposited nearby, the dislocation became
				incorporated into the lattice.</p>

				<p>As mentioned, future work is required to simulate more than about 30
				atoms. Our current implementation often fails to find a local minimum
				energy configuration if the number of mobile atoms is too high. The
				forces on each atom are above the threshold value of <span class="math">\(10^{-2}\)</span> eV /
				<span class="math">\(\buildrel _\circ \over {\mathrm{A}}\)</span> and fails to converge. The
				calculations themselves are clearly working, as small numbers of atoms
				easily find the minimum energy configuration. Perhaps another formalism
				for the conjugate step size would be more appropriate for this problem.</p>
