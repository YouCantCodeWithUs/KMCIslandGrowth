				<h2>Kinetic Monte Carlo</h2>
				
				<p>KMC bridges the gap between regular Monte Carlo sampling procedures and
				real time dynamics. It is useful for systems in which multiple events
				are occurring, such as MBE or CVD growth. The transition probabilities
				are directly tied to physical rates, establishing a “dynamical
				hierarchy” of events. In the dynamical hierarchy, events with lower
				energy barriers have a high probability of occurring sooner than events
				with high energy barriers. Therefore, events that occur at a low
				physical rate are rare.</p>
				
				<p>In our simulation of film growth, we can treat deposition and hopping as
				two independent events, which occur at different rates governed by
				relative energy barriers. The rate of deposition, <span class="math">\(R_{d},\)</span> is specified
				by the atomic flux. For MBE, this is typically one monolayer per second.
				The rate of diffusion of a surface atom, i is</p>
				
				<p><span class="math">\[r_{i}=\omega e^{(\Delta E_{i}/k_{B}T)}\label{eq:1}\]</span></p>
				
				<p>where <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> is the attempt rate, <span class="math">\(k_{b}\)</span> is the Boltzmann constant, T
				is temperature, and <span class="math">\(\Delta E_{i}\)</span> is the energy barrier for atom i to
				leave its current position and settle in a new one. Note that when
				<span class="math">\(\Delta E_{i}\)</span> is zero, <span class="math">\(r_{i}=\omega.\)</span> The total rate for all possible
				processes is then</p>
				
				<p><span class="math">\[R_{total}=R_{d}+\sum_{i=1}^{N}r_{i}\label{eq:2}\]</span></p>
				
				<p>for a system of N atoms. By this approach, a deposition event will occur
				with probability <span class="math">\(P_{d}=\frac{R_{d}}{R_{total}}\)</span>, and atom i will hop
				with probability <span class="math">\(P_{i}=\frac{r_{i}}{R_{total}}\)</span>.</p>
				
				<p>There are a variety of methods for choosing an event based on this
				information. The <em>n-fold-way</em> involves selecting a quasi-random number
				between 0 and <span class="math">\(R_{total}\)</span> with uniform probability. As shown in Figure
				1, the position of this random number along the
				continuum determines if a new atom is deposited or if an existing atom
				hops. It also determines which existing atom hops. The chosen event is
				then executed, and the rates updated to reflect the new state. This
				effectively avoids the waste of computation time associated with many
				failed attempts to move a specific atom.</p>

				<h2>(Approximate) Off-Lattice Monte Carlo</h2>
				
				<p>The nature of heteroepitaxy disallows the assumption that an adatom will
				occupy a periodic lattice position. When materials have different
				equilibrium bond lengths and bond energies, there is a very real
				possibility that it will be more energetically favorable for an adatom
				to occupy some position along a continuum between lattice sites. This
				significantly complicates growth simulations, however, because the space
				must be described as a potential energy landscape ridden with local
				minima, rather than a discrete set of potential moves.</p>
				
				<p>In an on-lattice algorithm, rates could be calculated for every
				potential move and stored in a rate catalog to be accessed later. One
				has to be more clever for off-lattice situations. In this case, atoms
				sit at local minimum energy positions, and they must overcome a
				potential energy barrier, <span class="math">\(\Delta U,\)</span> in order to move. Then the hopping
				rate from site i to site j will be:</p>
				
				<p><span class="math">\[r_{ij}=\omega e^{(-\Delta U_{ij}/k_{b}T)}\label{eq:3}\]</span></p>
				
				<p>The formal way to calculate <span class="math">\(\Delta U_{ij}\)</span> would be to find the
				difference between the local energy minimum and its neighboring saddle
				point where <span class="math">\(\nabla U=0.\)</span> Since these values are determined by all of
				the atoms in the configuration space, the act of finding and calculating
				them is rather computationally expensive. Instead, we will make an
				approximation based on the potential energy difference between the
				adatom in its current configuration, and the potential energy of the
				relaxed void as if the adatom had been removed.</p>
				
				<h2>Empirical Potential</h2>
				
				<p>The potential energies of different configurations will be calculated
				using the empirical Lennard-Jones potential. For an atom i interacting
				with another atom, j:</p>
				
				<p><span class="math">\[U_{ij}=\varepsilon_{ij}[(\frac{r_{m}}{r_{ij}})^{12}-2(\frac{r_{m}}{r_{ij}})^{6}]\]</span></p>
				
				<p>where <span class="math">\(\varepsilon_{ij}\)</span> is the potential well minimum, which occurs at
				<span class="math">\(r_{m}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(r_{ij}\)</span> is the measured distance between the two atoms. In
				physical terms, <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> is the chemical bond energy and <span class="math">\(r_{m}\)</span> is
				the nearest neighbor distance in a crystal. The force on an atom in an
				unstrained lattice is zero at <span class="math">\(r_{m}.\)</span> In a heteroepitaxial film, the
				binding energy and nearest neighbor distance between two adatoms will be
				different than for two substrate atoms. The interaction of an adatom,
				<span class="math">\(a\)</span>, with a substrate atom, s, will be described by some average in bond
				character. Explicitly, <span class="math">\(r_{m,a-s}=\frac{1}{2}(r_{m,a}+r_{m,s})\)</span> and
				<span class="math">\(\varepsilon_{a-s}=\sqrt{\varepsilon_{a}\varepsilon_{s}}.\)</span></p>
				
				<h2>Relaxation: Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient</h2>
				
				<p>When an atom hops or is deposited, it will initially arrive in a
				nonequilibrium position. It (and all of its neighbors) must then move
				towards the lowest energy configuration. The direction that they move
				depends on the gradient of the potential energy landscape. In
				particular, the force on each atom points in the direction of lowering
				its potential energy at the fastest rate. It does not necessarily point
				towards minimum energy position, however.</p>
				
				<p>A relatively fast way to find the minimum energy position is the
				conjugate gradient method. The force on each atom, <span class="math">\(\Delta x_0\)</span>, is
				initially calculated. The minimum energy along this direction is
				determined using a line search. The energy is sampled at various points,
				<span class="math">\(x_1 = x_0 + \alpha \Delta x_0\)</span>, along the direction of this vector and
				each atom is moved to the position with a value of <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> that
				minimizes the energy of the system. The direction of the force at this
				new position is calculated and the process is repeated. If the energy of
				the system is a linear system of equations that is symmetric and
				positive-definite, then this algorithm is guaranteed to eventually find
				a local minimum energy configuration.</p>
				
				<p>The conjugate gradient method can be extended to nonlinear systems with
				the addition of another term when calculating the direction of the
				minimum energy line search. Rather than moving along the direction of
				the force vector, a direction</p>
				
				<p><span class="math">\[s_n = \Delta x_n + \beta_n s_{n-1}\]</span></p>
				
				<p>is chosen where <span class="math">\(\beta_n\)</span> is the conjugate step size. The initial value
				<span class="math">\(s_0\)</span> is chosen as <span class="math">\(\Delta x_0\)</span>. Several forms for <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> exist in the
				literature; the Polak-Ribière formalism was used here:</p>
				
				<p><span class="math">\[\beta_n = \frac{\Delta x_n^\intercal (\Delta x_n - \Delta x_{n-1})}{\Delta x_{n-1}^\intercal \Delta x_{n-1}}\]</span></p>
				
				<p>The line search is then performed for positions
				<span class="math">\(x_{n+1} = x_n + \alpha s_n\)</span> and this process is repeated until the
				minimum energy is found. Figure 2 shows an example path of
				an atom searching for the minimum energy position using this method.</p>
				
				<p>In practice, the minimum energy is defined as a configuration where the
				forces on each particle are so small that they can be neglected. This
				cutoff point was chosen as <span class="math">\(10^{-2}\)</span> eV /
				<span class="math">\(\buildrel _\circ \over {\mathrm{A}}\)</span>.</p>
