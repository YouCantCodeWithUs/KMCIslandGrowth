				<h2 id="initialization">Initialization</h2>

				<p>Our system is based on a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure.
				This lends itself well to metallic films and substrates like Cu, Ni, Ag,
				Au , or Al. It can easily be extended to Si and GaAs. We begin by
				initializing a 2D hexagonal lattice with horizontally periodic boundary
				conditions. The outward facing plane is (111), and atoms are deposited
				on the (110) surface. A 2-dimensional system will allow us to
				effectively observe the strain-induced formation of dislocation and
				islands in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
				
				<p>Atoms are grouped by position into boxes of size <span class="math">\(3r_{m}\)</span> in order to
				facilitate truncation of the Lennard-Jones potential. Only atoms in the
				boxes neighboring the atom of interest will be included in potential
				energy calculations. For <span class="math">\(r_{ij}>3r_{m},\, U_{ij}\)</span> is within
				<span class="math">\(0.003 \, \varepsilon_{ij}\)</span> of zero, so this saves a significant amount
				of computation time with very minimal sacrifice of accuracy. Figure
				1 shows the (111) plane of the binned
				substrate with the first deposited atom on top. In order to avoid
				additional interfacial diffusion effects, we only allow the top layer of
				substrate atoms to move. Since there are no surface atoms in the very
				beginning, it is assumed that the deposition probability is 1. The first
				atom is just deposited randomly and relaxed into position without any
				additional rate calculations.</p>

				<p>The growth algorithm can be summarized in the following block diagram:</p>

				<h3 id="identificationofsurfaceatoms">Identification of Surface Atoms</h3>
				
				<p>Surface atoms are defined as any adatom that is coordinated by less than
				five nearest neighbors. As afore stated, substrate atoms are excluded
				from this list. Surface atoms are indicated by red dots in our figures.
				Fully coordinated atoms have six nearest neighbors, and are indicated by
				green dots.</p>
				
				<h3 id="determininghoppingrates">Determining Hopping Rates</h3>
				
				<p>For each identified surface atom, the hopping rate is calculated as in
				Equation [eq:3]. We set the attempt frequency, <span class="math">\(\omega,\)</span> equal to the
				rate of unhindered diffusion for a surface atom on a lattice:
				approximately <span class="math">\(10^{12}s^{-1}.\)</span> <span class="math">\(k_{B}=8.617\times10^{-5}eV/K\)</span>.
				Temperature may be varied.</p>
				
				<p>It was mentioned that <span class="math">\(\Delta U\)</span> would be approximated by a
				pseudo-bond-counting method:</p>
				
				<p><span class="math">\[\Delta U=\Delta U_{approx}-(\Delta U_{loc}-\Delta U_{loc}^{ideal})\]</span></p>
				
				<p>where$\Delta U_{approx}$ is the energy needed to completely remove an
				atom from its current configuration. This is calculated by summing the
				Lennard Jones potential over all the atoms in adjacent bins.
				<span class="math">\(\Delta U_{loc}^{ideal}\)</span> would be equivalent to the sum of the ideal
				energies in each of the local (nearest neighbor) bonds. For a surface
				atom coordinated by <span class="math">\(N_{s}\)</span> nearest substrate neighbors and <span class="math">\(N_{a}\)</span>
				nearest adatom neighbors,</p>
				
				<p><span class="math">\[\Delta U_{loc}^{ideal}=-(\varepsilon_{a-s}N_{s}+\varepsilon_{a}N_{a})\]</span></p>
				
				<p>On the other hand, <span class="math">\(\Delta U_{loc}\)</span> is the <em>actual</em> energy stored in the
				local bonds. It is calculated by summing the Lennard Jones potential
				over nearest neighbor atoms only. Therefore, the quantity
				<span class="math">\((\Delta U_{loc}-\Delta U_{loc}^{ideal})\)</span> accounts for lattice strain
				energy. For a relaxed homoepitaxial system,
				<span class="math">\(\Delta U\approxeq\Delta U_{approx}\)</span>.</p>
				
				<h3 id="totalrateandchoosinganevent">Total Rate and Choosing an Event</h3>
				
				<p>Once the hopping rates are computed for all N surface atoms, the partial
				sums</p>
				
				<p><span class="math">\[p_{j}=\sum_{i=1}^{j}r_{i}\]</span></p>
				
				<p>should be computed and stored. This yields a continuum of N hopping
				probabilities like the ones labeled in <a href="methods.html">Figure 1</a>
				for N=3. The total rate is given as in ([eq:2]).</p>
				
				<p>To choose an event, a random number <span class="math">\(u\in(0,R_{total})\)</span> is selected from
				a uniform distribution. If </p>
				
				<p><span class="math">\[\begin{cases}u < p_{j}, & \mathrm{Hop \, atom \, j}\\ u > p_{N}, & \mathrm{Deposit \, an \, atom}\end{cases}\]</span></p>
				
				<h3 id="hopping">Hopping</h3>
				
				<p>If an atom is chosen to hop, one surface atom is chosen at random from
				the adjacent bins. The potential, U(x), is then calculated at each of
				the 6 positions coordinating the chosen atom. The hopping atom moves to
				the position with the lowest energy. Finally, a local relaxation is
				performed around the destination using the nonlinear conjugate gradient
				method. </p>
				
				<h3 id="deposition">Deposition</h3>
				
				<p>If deposition is chosen, a random position is chosen within the bounds
				of the maximum film height and width. This position could end up being
				10 layers above the surface, which would take a long time to relax. To
				accomodate this possibility, the adatom is moved down by <span class="math">\(r_{a}\)</span> every
				time it finds itself more than <span class="math">\(2r_{a}\)</span> away from any other atoms. When
				it is finally within range, a local relaxation is performed using the
				nonlinear conjugate gradient method. </p>
				
				<h3 id="localvsglobalrelaxations">Local vs Global Relaxations</h3>
				
				<p>Relaxations using the nonlinear conjugate gradient method are performed
				to find the minimum energy positions of particles after hopping or
				deposition events. A local relaxation of just the atoms within
				<span class="math">\(3 \, r_m\)</span> of where the event occurred should be sufficient to find a
				new local minimum energy configuration within the threshold force value
				discussed previously. If the local relaxation causes atoms to move
				outside of this radius or causes atoms outside of the relaxation scope
				to experience forces greater than the threshold, then a global
				relaxation of all atoms is performed. Additionally, if the change in
				force from step to step is too small the the relaxation has lost
				conjugacy. In this case, the step size of the line search is halved and
				the relaxation step is performed again from the beginning. Our
				implementation of the local relaxation process was unstable, so only
				global relaxations were performed. Although this dramatically increased
				the computation time required for each step, it helped prevent forces
				from becoming too large.</p>
